      I played basketball from the time I could hold a ball until I graduated high school. Both of my parents played basketball growing up so I was encouraged to do the same. I have two younger sisters and they both played basketball too. My parents believe basketball teaches someone a lot of life lessons without them even realizing it. You have to learn to work with others, you have to fight back when you are down and things aren't going your way, and you learn that you aren't always going to be the best and win at everything.
