      I played basketball from the time I could hold a ball until I graduated high school. Both of my parents played basketball growing up so I was encouraged to do the same. I have two younger sisters and they both played basketball too. My parents believe basketball teaches someone a lot of life lessons without them even realizing it. You have to learn to work with others, you have to fight back when you are down and things aren't going your way, and you learn that you aren't always going to be the best and win at everything. Over the years I learned a lot of facts about basketabll.

        Basketball consists of a circular ball and a hoop. The object of the game is to shoot the ball through the hoop more times than the opposing team. Where you shoot the ball depends on how many points you recieve. There is three different point values: one point, two points, and three points.
