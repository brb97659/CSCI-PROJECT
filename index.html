      I played basketball from the time I could hold a ball until I graduated high school. Both of my parents played basketball growing up so I was encouraged to do the same. I have two younger sisters and they both played basketball too. My parents believe basketball teaches someone a lot of life lessons without them even realizing it. You have to learn to work with others, you have to fight back when you are down and things aren't going your way, and you learn that you aren't always going to be the best and win at everything. Over the years, I learned a lot of facts about basketabll. I also came to agree with my parents and their overall outlook on the game.

        Basketball consists of a circular ball and a hoop. The object of the game is to shoot the ball through the hoop more times than the opposing team. Where you shoot the ball depends on how many points you recieve. There is three different point values: one point, two points, and three points. Most games are broken up into four sections each being from 8 to 12 minutes depending on the league. Each team can have five players on the court at one time; you can swap players in and out whenever the game is stopped for multiple reasons. The court is rectangular shape and you have to stay within the lines in order to avoid a penalty.

      There are many rules and regulations in basketball. With every penalty, there is a consequence. Basketball season typically starts in the fall and goes through some of the winter. However, many leagues play year round. People at very different age ranges can play. Basketball can be played for fun and/or a career. There are many well paid celebrities known for basketball.
